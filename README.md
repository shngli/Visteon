# Visteon Corporation dashboard design
Visteon Corporation is a Michigan-based automotive supplier that currently operates in 26 countries, and offers innovative design and manufacture solutions to many major automakers across the globe. Some of their customers include BMW, Honda, Ford and General Motors. In particular, they aim to deliver exceptional driving experiences by enhancing the vehicles' climate control, interior design and functionality.

We were asked to redesign a vehicle's dashboard, which displays primary driving controls such as the speedometer and the odometer, or the vehicle's center stack where the radio, air controls and navigation functions are positioned. In order to manage the project scope, we choose to focus on redesigning just the dashboard.

Our goal is to examine the organization, product labeling and icons to display information in a more user-friendly manner. This project is motivated by the ever advancement in technologies that have facilitated the production of user-friendly products. Our client feels that the dashboard and center stack should be more intuitive and user-friendly. Hence, our project concentrates on consumer drivers and aims to meet their needs.
